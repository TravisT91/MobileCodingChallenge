It's unclear whether trips that start the prior day and end the next day are counted for the day
prior or the day the trip ends. I chose to select the day that the trip ends as the day that trip is
counted for, but it would be trivial to update the code to base it on the day the trip starts.

For the My Rides page, the header items are just part of the recycler view items, but could be
improved to be sticky headers that stay at the top until they are replaced by another day.
